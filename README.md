# Hello Welcome to 2022 AWS WorkShop Challenge

## The purpose of this Repo
The explosion of the cloud has changed the face of how enterprises do business, and itâ€™s not slowing down any time soon. **Cisco** believes that cloud data centers now process as much as 94% of all workloads. 
Also, someone wants to learn the cloud like AWS, Azure, Google, they didn't know where to find a lab or even get their hands dirty. Although a lot of people learn cloud by studying a certification, they didn't know how to fix the problems when they encounter that in the real world.

### AWS Workshop
The repo contains all the workshops that AWS provided, but we will check all the details as much as we can, and debug some errors whenever it was a free resource on the websites.
